Binary-Search-Tree in C:

This directory contains:

code that implements a Binary Search Tree of strings,
This program reads lines from stdin. Each line is appended onto a Binary Tree.
After end-of-file is read, the lines are printed out.

This demo contains the following files:
* bst.h: header file of tree structure

* bst.c: implementation of linked list

To compile:

$ make
To test it, try:

$ make demo
To delete binaries:

$ make clean
Challenges

There are many challenges that I learnt to use the c language as line indentation,
Algorithm for example, Binary Search tree Delete, Search, insert, and also different
traversal. Moreover, I also learnt to use the pointers which was more complex term in this project.
